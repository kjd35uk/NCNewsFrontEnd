**Northcoders News --- https://kirstie-nc-news.herokuapp.com/**
Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. In a similar way to Reddit, Northcoders News has articles which are organised into topics. Users have the opportunity to rate articles by using a voting system - articles can be up or down voted using the API. It is also possible to add comments about an article or add a new article to an existing topic. As with articles, comments can  be up or down voted. A user may add comments to an article or remove any previously added comments, although it is not possible to delete comments made by other users. The front-end for Northcoders News has been developed using React, React Router and axios. 

This React router project uses axios to integrate with an Express backend(https://northcoders-news-kirstiecodes.herokuapp.com/)
